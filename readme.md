## Lexicon Game

The goal of this game is to guess the unknown word. Consider it a mix between Hangman and Mastermind, and arguably closest in game mechanics to Jotto.

## Execution

Open a new terminal window and enter the following command in the root directory of the cloned repository:

```
npm run-script server
```

Open another terminal window and enter the following command in the root directory of the repository:

```
npm run-script client
```

Please make sure that the server is running prior to launching the client.

The game can then be played via the web user interface. Enjoy!
